# 📊 Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes Netflix’s content dataset to uncover insights into trends in movies and TV shows. Using SQL (specifically adapted for SQL Server), we answer various business and user-oriented questions such as:

- Most frequent content ratings per type (Movie/TV Show)
- Content distribution by country and genre
- Yearly trends of content addition over the last 5 years
- Top contributing directors and actors
- Genre popularity and release patterns
- Specific content filters (e.g., by actor, country, release period)

## 🧰 Tools Used:
- SQL Server
- Microsoft SQL Management Studio (SSMS) / Azure Data Studio
- Git for version control

## 📁 Dataset:
- The dataset is based on the public **Netflix Titles** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows), which includes:
  - `title`, `type`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in`, and `description`.

## ✅ Key Objectives:
- Practice real-world SQL queries
- Clean and transform semi-structured data
- Derive meaningful insights for data storytelling
- Prepare for data analysis and data science interviews
